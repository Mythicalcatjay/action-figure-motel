# action-figure-motel
![white-logo-image]

A template to make your own website to display your OCs, worlds, and whatever you'd like built for artists, roleplayers, writers, furries, and all else. 

# How to use
Make your own hotel by importing pages into a website creator like neocities and editing them to match the aesthetics and information you want to display on your website. Each has in-depth instructions on how to edit them, even if it is suggested to know a little bit of html and css or be willing to learn it. Hopefully, this is beginner friendly and I'll be happy to tweak and explain things better.
